1. Copy the Detachment.csv into the debug folder.
Path: \WH40app\WH40app\bin\Debug

I only used Xampp for the Database so this file only contains instructions for it.

2. To open the website I copied it into the Xampp/htdocs/ folder.
After that open the localhost/WH40Shop URL.
 
Xampp needs to be running to work and the MYSQL modul must be running.

3. Import the Zarodolgozat.sql file into a Database created in Xampp called Zarodolgozat.
